# 📘 Adobe Analytics Hackathon – Challenge 1A & 1B



This repository contains two modular projects designed to process PDF documents for user-specific tasks using AI/NLP.  

Each project targets a specific challenge:  



- 🔍 **Challenge 1A** – Heading Detection & Metadata Extraction  

- 📊 **Challenge 1B** – Contextual PDF Section Ranking & Summarization



Both tools are **Dockerized** for plug-and-play execution.
